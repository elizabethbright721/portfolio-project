By Elizabeth Bright

**Purpoe of application**
This application allow you to search quotes for daily motivation.  

You can search either a "keyword" such as "win", "success", "love", "hope", etc., which will produce a list of motivational quotes by various authors or you can search quotes by author (i.e., Michael Jordan).  

The second page allows the user to subscribe to receiving a motivational quote in their email everyday by completing the form.
